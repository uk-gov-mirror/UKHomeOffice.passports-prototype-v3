    <h1>{{ hmpoTitle }}</h1>

    <p>Her Majesty’s Passport Office is introducing a way for customers to retrieve a digital photo when they apply for their passport online.</p>

    <p>
        Currently, customers can only upload a digital photo stored on their own device or provided by a photo shop on a memory stick, email or CD.
        With this new solution, booths and shops in the UK will be able to give customers a photo code with their printed passport photos.
        When customers apply online, they can use this code to retrieve their digital passport photo taken at a booth or by a photographer.
        This provides greater choice for our customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppliers of digital passport photos will need to establish a secure process for storing and transferring their customers’ digital photos.
        Her Majesty’s Passport Office will continue to check that all photos meet the rules for UK passports.
    </p>

    <h2>Providing digital passport photo codes &ndash; advice for photo shops</h2>
    <p>To enable your customers to use this new service, you need to:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>host your digital passport photos securely on the internet</li>
        <li>convert the full HTTPS internet address (URL) into a shortened version</li>
        <li>provide the shortened internet address to customers as a photo code</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical instructions</h2>
    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number instructions">
        <li>
            Upload the digital photo to a publically accessible host on the internet.
            It must be possible to access the photo via a secure shortened internet address (URL) from anywhere on the internet.
        </li>
        <li>
            The photo must be a JPEG between 50KB and 10MB. The ideal image size is 3MB.
            It must be possible to retrieve the photo in less than 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            The photo must meet the <a href="/help/photo-rules" class="new-window" target="_blank">rules for digital passport photos</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The full HTTPS internet address (URL) of the photo must be converted into a shortened version.
            URL shortening services are available.
        </li>
        <li>
            The shortened version must follow the format of sub-domain (1-6 characters), top-level-domain (2-3 characters), and path (6-8 characters), for example photo.co/yh8Y6K2s
        </li>
        <li>
            Provide the shortened URL to your customer.
            Make sure you describe it as a ‘photo code’ and include details of how customers can contact you if there’s a problem with their digital photo.
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement the optional secure web token to restrict photo retrieval to HMPO only.
            HMPO use a JWS (JSON Web Signature) in the Authorization header, signed with our private key that can be authenticated using our published <a href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/photo/public/keys/photo-code-auth-key.pub">public key</a>.
            The ‘sub’ in the JWS token is the HTTPS URL of the photo code and can be checked.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This is the example photo code shown to applicants when they apply online<br/>
        <img class="full-width-image" src="{{assetPath}}/images/printed-photo-code.jpg" alt="" />
    </p>
