    <h1>{{ hmpoTitle }}</h1>

    <p>You may be asked to come for an interview at a <a id="link-interview-office" href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-interview-office" target="_blank">passport office</a> if you’ve never had a UK passport before, or your old passport expired some time ago.</p>

    <p>The interview helps us confirm who you are and that the passport application belongs to you.</p>

    <p>It’s an important part of protecting your identity. It stops other people applying for a passport in your name.</p>

    <h2>What happens at the interview</h2>
    <p>Your appointment will last about 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>We’ll ask you some questions that someone trying to steal your identity may not know. We’ll also check your photo looks like you.</p>

    {% call hmpoInsetText() %}
        <p>You won’t get your new passport on the day. We’ll carry out final checks on your application before we send your new passport.</p>
    {% endcall %}

    <p>You can bring a friend or relative with you to the office, but they can’t sit with you during the interview.</p>

    <h2>Booking your appointment</h2>
    <p>We’ll send you a letter asking you to phone for an appointment. When you call, tell us if you need:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a hearing loop</li>
        <li>wheelchair access</li>
        <li>a sign language interpreter</li>
        <li>someone to be with you during the interview, such as a parent or carer</li>
        <li>a private interview room because you don’t want to uncover your face in public</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Help if you have a disability</h2>
    <p>Most offices have wheelchair access and hearing loops, and some have disabled toilets and parking. Ask what facilities are available when you book.</p>

    <p>If you have a mental or physical disability that would prevent you from coming and taking part in an interview, you’ll need to send a letter from a doctor.</p>

    <p>The letter should explain why you can’t attend and if your disability is likely to be permanent. Include it with your documents.</p>
