    <h2>Who can confirm someone’s identity</h2>
    <p>For some passport applications, HM Passport Office needs someone to confirm the applicant’s identity. This helps protect their identity and check the application belongs to the right person.</p>

    <p>To confirm someone’s identity online, you need to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be 18 or older</li>
        <li>and work in or be retired from a recognised profession</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must also be either:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a current UK passport holder living in the UK - if the applicant lives in and is applying from the UK</li>
        <li>a current UK, Irish or other EU, US or Commonwealth passport holder - if the applicant lives and is applying from outside the UK</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're not a UK or Irish passport holder it will take longer for us to process the application.</p>
    <p>You need to have known the applicant, or the person making the application, personally for at least 2 years – for example as a friend, neighbour or colleague.</p>
    <p>You must not be related, in a relationship with or living at the same address as the applicant or the person making the application. </p>
